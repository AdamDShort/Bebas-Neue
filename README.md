There is a need for common platform to develope and share the result for more usability and quality of the font.

## "Bebas Neue Family(2014)" vs "Bebas Neue v2.000(2018)"
As mentioned above, Bebas Neue Family (2014) were designed by [Font fabirc](http://www.fontfabric.com/bebas-neue/) and they made a big contribution to the world use. I appreciate Svet and Fontfabric team very much.  
"Bebas Neue Family (2014)" was designed based on the "Bebas Neue version 1.xxx(2007)". Therefore, some part of the design and character set, some setting between the Family(2014) and version 2.000(2018) are slightly differnt.
